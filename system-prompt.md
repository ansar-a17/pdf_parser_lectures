2. Each generates EPSP (or IPSP)
3. EPSPs spread along dendritic membrane
4. Converge at soma
5. Individual depolarizations add together
6. Total depolarization = sum of all individual EPSPs

7. Integrated signal reaches axonhügel

- ✓ If below threshold → no AP
- ✓ Allows integration of information from many sources

#### Integration of Both Types (Zeitliche + Räumliche)

**Combined Summation:**
- ✓ Both types can occur together
- ✓ Multiple synapses (räumlich) each firing repeatedly (zeitlich)
- ✓ Most realistic scenario in neurons

- ✓ Algebraic summation
- ✓ Example calculations (if in notes):
  - 3 EPSPs (+5 mV each) = +15 mV
  - 1 IPSP (-8 mV) = -8 mV
  - Net = +15 + (-8) = +7 mV
- ✓ Can cancel each other out
- ✓ Balance determines if threshold is reached

**Net Effect Calculation:**
- ✓ Sum all EPSPs (total depolarization)
- ✓ Sum all IPSPs (total hyperpolarization)
- ✓ Net change = EPSP total + IPSP total
- ✓ Compare to Schwellenwert
- ✓ Any formulas or quantitative relationships from notes

**Complete Outcome Scenarios:**
